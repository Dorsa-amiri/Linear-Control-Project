# Linear Control Project
## Project Overview
This project was conducted as part of a university coursework on linear control systems. It focuses on designing controllers for a closed-loop system in the time domain. The objective is to meet specific time-domain specifications, including:  
- Maximum overshoot ≤ 30%  
- Settling time ≤ 3 seconds  
- System gain Kv ≤ 3.4  

Multiple controllers were designed and evaluated based on their performance. The results, including step responses, stability analysis, and MATLAB simulations, are documented in the project report.

### **Prerequisites**
- MATLAB (R202X or later)  
- Simulink  

### **How to Run**
1. Open `final.slx` in MATLAB Simulink.  
2. Run the Simulink model to observe system responses.  
3. Open `finalproj.mlx` in MATLAB to see code execution and results.
